# Weather App - Routing & Navigation

## Goal

Learn how to navigate between components.

## Tasks

### 1. Add navigation to your application

#### Requirements

- The Dashboard screen should be displayed if the user navigates to `/dashboard`
  or `/`.
  - The tiles should navigate to `/{cityId}` with the built-in routing
    mechanism.
- The proper Forecast screen should be displayed if the user navigates to
  `/{cityId}`.
- A common Error screen (with a link to the Dashboard) should be displayed in
  any other case.

#### Hints

- Take a look at angular's
  [Routing & Navigation guide](https://angular.io/guide/router).
